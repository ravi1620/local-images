    <b>Conceptual differences between private and public sector banks-</b>
    <br>
        <strong>Private banks-</strong>
         Banks in the private sector are known for their fierce competition and technological prowess. As a result, careers in private banking are more competitive, with professionals being obliged to fulfil strict targets and perform above par in order to advance their careers. The risk-to-reward ratio is also higher, and income may be better, but job security may not be as good as it is at publicly-owned institutions.
        Required Education- A bachelor’s degree in economics, business, or finance is usually sufficient to lay a solid foundation for a banking career. Most private banks will require a bachelor’s degree in one of these fields as well as an MBA from a reputable college. Instead of depending on newspaper advertisements, they prefer to hire fresh talent through campus recruitment, referrals, and walk-ins through consultants. However, depending on the amount of openings, they may or may not be advertised. They are not required to follow reservation regulations in terms of giving a fixed number of positions to certain pre-designated groups of people. Private banks are looking for youthful, competitive individuals who appreciate working under duress and believe in giving it their all.
        Employment- Private sector banks have been steadily developing, providing high-end services to a diverse customer base while maximising technological capabilities. Private banks compete in a fiercely competitive market, and they frequently employ aggressive client engagement techniques to capitalise on their ability to provide high-quality services in the shortest amount of time.
        <br>
        <strong>Public Banks-</strong>
        Public sector banks are known for having a more organised organisational structure and a larger customer base. In comparison to privately-owned banks, the work climate is also less competitive, and professionals are less likely to be focused on hitting targets and being the best performance in a team. There is usually a larger emphasis on offering appropriate training to their employees in order to help them refresh their knowledge and abilities in order to improve their performance in the long run. When compared to private sector banks, job security is substantially stronger, and for some, this may be the most important factor in establishing a long-term career.
        Required education- Candidates are chosen after passing a series of common entrance exams administered by public sector banks. A government banking job is open to graduates from any subject. As a public banker, candidates should have a strong understanding of finance, accounting, and banking processes, as well as great communication skills.
        However, the standards are less stringent than those of private banks, but one must pass the test. As government-owned financial organisations, they are bound by specific state-imposed norms and restrictions when it comes to hiring. Typically, they must post any job openings in major publications and follow reservation criteria to determine how many positions will be reserved for people from underrepresented groups in society.
        
        Employment- The demand for banking professionals is increasing as the government continues to expand the scope and reach of publicly-owned banks to the most remote corners of the country. However, because of the greater perks and job stability available, a far higher number of people apply for a relatively small number of posts, increasing competitiveness. In 2013, for example, roughly 40 lakh applications were submitted for 80,000 government bank jobs. Despite all of the claimed benefits of a career in public banking, passing the exam can be a difficult nut to crack.
        The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is India’s highest banking regulator, and it was established in 1934 under the RBI Act. Scheduled Banks and Non-Scheduled Banks are the two major types of banks in India. Commercial banks are divided into two groups based on ownership: Private Sector Banks and Public Sector Banks, as well as two additional groupings: Regional Rural Banks and Foreign Banks. We will, however, be able to see a list of PSU and private banks in India.
