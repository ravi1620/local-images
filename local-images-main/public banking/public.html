        <p>State Bank of India (<b>SBI</b>) raised the marginal cost of the fund-based lending rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points (bps) across all tenures. The increase in MCLR by SBI comes days after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) left the key policy rate unchanged.
            The move is likely to be followed by other lenders, resulting in costlier loans for borrowers.
            
            The country’s largest lender has revised one year MCLR to 8.75 per cent from 8.65 per cent. Onernight MCLR has been raised to 8.1 per cent from 8 per cent. The one and three-month MCLR have been revised upwards to 8.3 per cent each from 8.2 per cent earlier.
            
            The revised MCLR for two-year and three-year MCLRs are 8.85 per cent and 8.95 per cent, respectively. The new rates are effective from today.</p>

            <h2><del>3.Bank of Baroda</del></h2>
            <img src="../public banking/Bank-of-Baroda.jpg" height="300px"> 
            <p>Bank of Baroda (<i>BOB or BoB</i>) is an Indian government Public sector bank headquartered in Vadodara, Gujarat. It is the second largest public sector bank in India after State Bank of India. Based on 2023 data, it is ranked 586 on the Forbes Global 2000 list.[6][7][8]

                <em>The Maharaja of Baroda</em>, Sayajirao Gaekwad III, founded the bank on 20 July 1908 in the princely state of Baroda, in Gujarat.[9] The Government of India nationalized the Bank of Baroda, along with 13 other major commercial banks of India, on 19 July 1969 and the bank was designated as a profit-making public sector undertaking (PSU).
                
                <br>
                In 1908, <mark>Sayajirao Gaekwad III</mark>, set up the Bank of Baroda (BoB),[10] with other stalwarts of industry such as Sampatrao Gaekwad, Ralph Whitenack, Vithaldas Thakersey, Lallubhai Samaldas, Tulsidas Kilachand and NM Chokshi.[11] Two years later, BoB established its first branch in Ahmedabad. The bank grew domestically until after World War II. Then in 1953 it crossed the Indian Ocean to serve the communities of Indians in Kenya and Indians in Uganda by establishing a branch each in Mombasa and Kampala. The next year it opened a second branch in Kenya, in Nairobi, and in 1956 it opened a branch in Tanzania at Dar-es-Salaam. Then in 1957, BoB took a big step abroad by establishing a branch in London. London was the center of the British Commonwealth and the most important international banking center. In 1958 BoB acquired Hind Bank (Calcutta; est. 1943), which became BoB's first domestic acquisition.[citation needed]
